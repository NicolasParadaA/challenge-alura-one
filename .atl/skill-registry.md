# Skill Registry — bimbam-agent-final

## Sources scanned

- `{project-root}/skills/` (project-level — none found)
- `{project-root}/.opencode/skills/` (project-level — none found)

## Contract

**Delegator use only.** This registry is an index, not a summary. Any agent that launches subagents reads it to select relevant skills, then passes exact `SKILL.md` paths for the subagent to read before work.

`SKILL.md` remains the source of truth. Do not inject generated summaries or compact rules by default; pass paths so subagents load the full runtime contract and preserve author intent.

### SDD Workflow (Core)

| Skill | Trigger / description | Scope | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sdd-init` | Trigger: sdd init, iniciar sdd, openspec init. Initialize SDD context, testing capabilities, registry, and persistence. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-init\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-explore` | Explore SDD ideas before committing to a change. Trigger: orchestrator launches exploration or requirement clarification. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-explore\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-propose` | Create an SDD change proposal with intent, scope, and approach. Trigger: orchestrator launches proposal work for a change. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-propose\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-spec` | Write SDD delta specs with requirements and scenarios. Trigger: orchestrator launches spec work for a change. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-spec\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-design` | Create the SDD technical design and architecture approach. Trigger: orchestrator launches design for a change. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-design\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-tasks` | Break an SDD change into implementation tasks. Trigger: orchestrator launches task planning for a change. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-tasks\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-apply` | Implement SDD tasks from specs and design. Trigger: orchestrator launches apply for one or more change tasks. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-apply\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-verify` | Trigger: SDD verification phase, verify change. Execute tests and prove implementation matches specs, design, and tasks. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-verify\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-archive` | Archive a completed SDD change by syncing delta specs. Trigger: orchestrator launches archive after implementation and verification. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-archive\SKILL.md` |
| `sdd-onboard` | Walk users through the SDD workflow on the real codebase. Trigger: orchestrator launches onboarding for the full SDD cycle. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\sdd-onboard\SKILL.md` |

### Skill Management

| Skill | Trigger / description | Scope | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `skill-registry` | Trigger: update skills, skill registry, actualizar skills, after skill changes. Index available skills by trigger and path. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\skill-registry\SKILL.md` |
| `skill-creator` | Trigger: new skills, agent instructions, documenting AI usage patterns. Create LLM-first skills with valid frontmatter. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\skill-creator\SKILL.md` |
| `skill-improver` | Trigger: improve skills, audit skills, refactor skills, skill quality. Audit and upgrade existing LLM-first skills. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\skill-improver\SKILL.md` |

### Collaboration & Code Quality

| Skill | Trigger / description | Scope | Path |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `branch-pr` | Create Gentle AI pull requests with issue-first checks. Trigger: creating, opening, or preparing PRs for review. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\branch-pr\SKILL.md` |
| `chained-pr` | Trigger: PRs over 400 lines, stacked PRs, review slices. Split oversized changes into chained PRs that protect review focus. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\chained-pr\SKILL.md` |
| `issue-creation` | Create Gentle AI issues with issue-first checks. Trigger: creating GitHub issues, bug reports, or feature requests. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\issue-creation\SKILL.md` |
| `comment-writer` | Write warm, direct collaboration comments. Trigger: PR feedback, issue replies, reviews, Slack messages, or GitHub comments. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\comment-writer\SKILL.md` |
| `judgment-day` | Trigger: judgment day, dual review, adversarial review, juzgar. Run explicit blind dual review with at most two scoped fix/re-judgment rounds. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\judgment-day\SKILL.md` |
| `work-unit-commits` | Plan commits as reviewable work units. Trigger: implementation, commit splitting, chained PRs, or keeping tests and docs with code. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\work-unit-commits\SKILL.md` |
| `cognitive-doc-design` | Design docs that reduce cognitive load. Trigger: writing guides, READMEs, RFCs, onboarding, architecture, or review-facing docs. | user | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\cognitive-doc-design\SKILL.md` |

### Shared References

| Skill | Description | Path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `_shared` | Shared SDD references for installed skills. Not invokable. | `C:\Users\Nicolas\.config\opencode\skills\_shared\SKILL.md` |

## Project Convention Files

- None detected (no AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, GEMINI.md, or copilot-instructions.md found).

## Loading protocol

1. Match task context and target files against the `Trigger / description` column.
2. Pass only the matching `Path` values to the subagent under `## Skills to load before work`.
3. Instruct the subagent to read those exact `SKILL.md` files before reading, writing, reviewing, testing, or creating artifacts.
4. If no matching skill exists, proceed without project skill injection and report `skill_resolution: none`.
